    <p>
      <b>Robin McLaurin Williams</b> was an American actor and comedian. After rising to fame as Mork in the sitcom Mork & Mindy(1978–82), he went on to establish a career in both stand-up comedy and feature film acting. As his comedy goes, he was best known for his improvisational skills. Starting as a stand-up comedian in San Francisco and Los Angeles in the mid-1970s, he is credited with leading San Francisco’s comedy renaissance.</p>
    <p>After his film debut in the musical comedy Popeye (1980), he starred or co-starred in widely acclaimed films. Including the comedy-drama The World According to Garp (1982), war comedy Good Morning, Vietnam (1987), dramas Dead Poets Society (1989) and Awakenings (1990). Comedy-drama The Fisher King (1991), the animated musical-fantasy Aladdin (1992), drama Good Will Hunting (1997). And also psychological thriller One Hour Photo (2002), as well as financial successes such as the fantasy adventure film Hook (1991), comedy Mrs. Doubtfire (1993), fantasy adventure Jumanji (1995), the comedy The Birdcage(1996), and the Night at the Museum trilogy.</p>
    
    <p>The actor died at 63 on Aug. 11 at his home in Tiburon, Calif. in Marin County. Toxicology reports reveal antidepressants, caffeine and levodopa, a drug used to treat Parkinson's disease, in his system. Williams had battled severe depression for years and had recently been diagnosed with Parkinson's, his widow, Susan, revealed after his death. He also had a "recent increase in paranoia," according to a medical history authorities recorded at the scene.</p>

    <p>The night before Williams died, he had placed several wristwatches in a sock and dropped them off with someone (whose name was redacted) because he was worried about the timepieces and "wanted to keep them safe," according to the report. Then at 7:09 p.m. he called Susan to tell her he was picking up magazines for her at the bookstore.</p>

    <p>When he returned home, Williams handed Susan the magazines and seemed "OK," she told investigators. Then he was in and out of their bedroom, rummaging through their closet. He left with his iPad, and Susan said "she recalled thinking it was a good thing he grabbed it, because she assumed he was in a good mood and was going to take time to do some reading; he hadn't read or watched TV in six months." He left the bedroom around 10:30 p.m. — it would be the last time she saw him.</p>

    <p>Twelve hours later, Susan believed her husband was still sleeping and left the house. At about 11:45 a.m. Aug. 11, Williams' assistant grew concerned. He slipped a note under the door, then picked the lock. He found the comedian dressed in a long black T-shirt and belted black jeans hanging by a nylon belt in a closet door frame. The actor, who was being treated for severe depression, also had cuts on his wrist. He wasn't wearing a ring or a watch.</p>

    <p>Williams was found in an empty bedroom belonging to his stepson, who was away visiting his father. The actor slept in a separate bedroom because he was having a hard time sleeping and was "restless due to his Parkinson's and anxiety issues," and talked in his sleep, the investigator's report says. The room had a bunk bed — the top bunk was neatly made — the bottom bunk crumpled and the bedding pulled down.</p>
